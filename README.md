I began to write these notes in 2020, during the ecological modelling classes (Modelação Ecológica, ME in short) at FCUL. While it all started as just a way to teach the ME course, providing support material for what we did in class with the students, it latter became obvious that with a bit of extra effort put into it these might become material that would be useful to others beyond the ME students.

For the current version I am keeping chapters as individual lectures. Once the classes are over I might organize them into sensible chapters for a possible book on statistical models for ecological data

I do not make any claims about the quality of the content beyhond it being useful to ME students, so feel free to browse it at your own risk!
