These notes were written in 2020, during the ecological modelling classes (Modelação Ecológica, ME in short). While it all started as just a way to teach the course, it latter became obvious that with a bit of extra effort put into it these might become material that would be useful to others beyond the ME students.

For the current version I am keeping chapters as individual lectures. Once the classes are over I might organize them into sensible chapters for a possible book on statistical models for ecological data.
